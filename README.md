## A Multivariate Analysis Exploration

Traffic fatalities in the United States have been the highest as compared to most highincome countries. The objective of the current study is to examine the correlates of traffic fatalities in the U.S. and identify groups of states that display higher traffic fatality using statistical clustering techniques. Further, I also try to see the incidence of traffic fatality in the statistical clusters to further validate my results. This project is a multivariate statistical exploration and informs important policy action plan.
